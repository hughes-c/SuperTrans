HOW TO setup sesc/SuperTrans
-----------------------

This README provides a quickstart guide for setting up and running 
your first benchmark on SuperTrans. SuperTrans is built on top of
SESC, which can be found at:

http://sourceforge.net/projects/sesc/


building sesc/SuperTrans and running your first benchmark
----------------------------------------------------

1) create a build directory

> mkdir bin

   We recommend that you have one build directory per simulator
   set of options. You may create as many directories as you want and
   compile the simulator with different combinations of options (see
   step 3).

2) go to the build directory

> cd bin

3) configure SESC/SuperTrans from build

> ../src/configure --enable-transactional

# Note for debugging builds
# ../src/configure --enable-transactional --enable-debug

4) build sesc/SuperTrans:

> make

5) copy example configuration files

> cp ../confs/* .

6) run test benchmark

> ./sesc.trans ../benchmarks/testBench
